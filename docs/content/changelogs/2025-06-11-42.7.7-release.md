**Notable changes**

### Security
* security: **Client Allows Fallback to Insecure Authentication Despite channelBinding=require configuration.**
  Fix `channel binding required` handling to reject non-SASL authentication
  Previously, when channel binding was set to "require", the driver would silently ignore this
  requirement for non-SASL authentication methods. This could lead to a false sense of security
  when channel binding was explicitly requested but not actually enforced. The fix ensures that when
  channel binding is set to "require", the driver will reject connections that use
  non-SASL authentication methods or when SASL authentication has not completed properly.
